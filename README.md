# Home Assistant

Home Assistant is powerful and includes a number of capabilities and features out of the box.

However, it also needs proper design and configuration to meet my current and future needs, primarily to manage historical data and visualization.\
Therefore it requires quite alot of though and detail to setup and configure.

My Home Assistant installation is setup according to the following:
